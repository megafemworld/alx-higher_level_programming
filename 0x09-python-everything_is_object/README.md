## Python - Everything is Object

This project focuses on exploring the concept of objects in Python and understanding the differences between mutable and immutable objects. It delves into the intricacies of variables, references, aliases, and object manipulation in Python.

### Project Overview
- **Start Date:** April 9, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** April 10, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** April 9, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Launched at the deadline

### Background Context
The project prompts participants to understand Python's approach to handling objects and how variables are assigned and manipulated. It emphasizes the importance of grasping these concepts for interviews and real-world Python programming scenarios.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, participants are expected to:
- Understand Python programming fundamentals and its object-oriented nature
- Differentiate between classes and objects, mutable and immutable objects
- Comprehend concepts like references, aliases, and variable assignment
- Know how to identify identical variables and objects, and display variable identifiers
- Recognize built-in mutable and immutable types in Python
- Understand how Python passes variables to functions

### Requirements
- Python Scripts: All scripts should follow specific guidelines regarding editors, interpreters, file endings, and style checks.
- .txt Answer Files: Answers to tasks should be succinct and adhere to formatting requirements.

### Conclusion
The project aims to enhance participants' understanding of Python's object model and its implications for programming. Through theoretical exploration and practical examples, participants will develop a deeper comprehension of Python's underlying mechanisms.
